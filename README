Set of shell utilities (dot files, scripts, etc) of usage on a (at least mine) daily basis.

Here are found
- timetracker: simple command line activity time logger.
- monitoring: set of scripts for gathering and visualizing system stats. Probable should not be under shell-misc-tools, but for the time being is.
- vim: vim configuration/plugins
- zsh: zsh configuration/plugins
